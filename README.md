## Description

This project uses asynchronous code and an API called ExchangeRate to create a currency exchanging application. An integer input box is given for the user to enter the amount of USD they wish to find an exchange rate for. The second input box is for the user to select one of the 160 currencies available to convert to. Lastly the user can click the blue Submit button to display the conversion rate along with the name of the currency the user selected to convert to.
